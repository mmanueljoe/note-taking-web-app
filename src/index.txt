App Overview
Purpose: Note-taking web app with theming, auth, and settings; data stored in localStorage.
Tech: Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS; no backend. Runs entirely in browser (works on Vercel/static hosting).
State/storage: Preferences, auth state, notes, and user records kept in localStorage.
Key Modules
src/js/main.js: App bootstrap, note list rendering, interactions (create/edit/archive/search).
src/js/noteManager.js: CRUD helpers for notes and archives using localStorage.
src/js/auth.js: Local auth (signup/login/logout/change password), password hashing/checking (client-side).
src/js/auth-handlers.js: Wire auth forms to auth.js, handle validation/messages.
src/js/settings.js: Settings page (theme, font, change password, logout modal with focus trap).
src/js/theme.js: Apply color theme and font, persist to storage.
src/js/utils.js: Helpers (DOM queries, debounce, focus management: trapFocus, restoreFocus).
src/js/ui.js: Shared UI behaviors (modals, toasts, etc.).
CSS: src/css/styles.css (global), plus feature-specific styles (auth, settings).
Core Flows (implemented)
Signup/Login (localStorage): Stores user record (email + hashed password). Login checks hash; sets session flag in storage.
Logout: Clears session; settings page includes an accessible confirmation modal with focus trap.
Change Password: Validates inputs, updates stored hash; shows inline errors/success.
Notes: Create, edit, delete, archive; filter/search; uses localStorage for persistence.
Theming: Color + font selection; persisted; applied on load.
Accessibility touches: Focus trap for modals (trapFocus), aria labels on buttons; toasts/messages.
Constraints & Security Notes
No backend: All logic and data live client-side; suitable for demo/lab, not for production security.
localStorage: Origin-scoped; persists per browser/profile; not secure for secrets; size ~5–10 MB.
Planned/Not Yet Merged Additions (localStorage-only, simulated)
Forgot/Reset Password (simulated):
“Forgot password?” link opens a form to enter email.
On submit: if a user exists, generate a short-lived reset token in localStorage (resetToken, resetTokenExpiry) and display a “reset link” on screen (simulated email). If not, show the same generic message.
Reset page reads token from URL or input, validates against stored token + expiry, then lets user set a new password (with confirm/strength checks), clears the token, and returns to login with success message.
UI copy clarifies it’s a demo/no real email.
Mock Google Login (simulated):
“Continue with Google (demo)” button opens a fake account picker modal.
On selection: create/find a localStorage user flagged as google and set session. No external OAuth or real Google sign-in.
UI copy states it’s a mock/demo flow.
How to Explain It Verbally
Architecture: “Everything is client-side—HTML/CSS/JS. State and user data live in localStorage. No network or backend calls.”
Auth: “Signup/login store hashed passwords locally; sessions are tracked in localStorage. Logout and change password are handled in the settings page.”
Notes: “Notes CRUD + archive are managed via localStorage; UI updates the list from that store.”
Settings/Themes: “Users pick color/font themes; choices persist and apply on load.”
Accessibility: “Modals trap focus (trapFocus in utils.js); buttons have aria-labels.”
Limitations: “LocalStorage isn’t secure; ‘forgot password’ and ‘Google login’ are mock flows for demo purposes—no emails, no real OAuth.”
If Asked About Vercel
“Works fine—localStorage is browser-side. Each domain/preview has its own storage; data won’t carry between them.”
Quick Demo Script
Open app: show notes list, add a note, archive it, restore/delete.
Switch theme/font; refresh to show persistence.
Auth flow: log out, log back in (localStorage users), change password, log in with new password.
(If added) Trigger “Forgot password?” → see simulated reset link → use token to reset.
(If added) Use mock Google button → select demo account → show logged-in state.
